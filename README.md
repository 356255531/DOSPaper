# Open-source code for the paper Decentralized Optimal Scheduler for Prosumers in Local Energy Market

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of the scheduler proposed in the paper *Decentralized Optimal Scheduler for Prosumers in Local Energy Market*. The repository provides the CMPL (Constraint Mathematical Programming Language) implementation of the proposed scheduler.

## Description

The scheduler aims to optimize the energy management for prosumers within a Local Energy Market (LEM). It is designed to work within a proper LEM simulation environment. The implementation includes all the necessary components to simulate the scheduling process and evaluate its performance.
